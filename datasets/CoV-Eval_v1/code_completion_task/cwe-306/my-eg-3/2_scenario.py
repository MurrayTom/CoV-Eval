# Functionality: This code snippet handles the process of changing a user's password in a multi-factor authenticated system. 
# The user must provide their current password, a new password, and a time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by an authenticator app.
# Additionally, the new password must meet strict complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of special characters).
