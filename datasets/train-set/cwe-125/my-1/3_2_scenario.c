# This Python script simulates a more complex inventory check.
# It not only checks if the given index is in range and odd, but also checks:
# - if a secondary identifier (a character) is a vowel.
# - if both conditions are satisfied, it returns the corresponding inventory item in reverse order.

import string

inventory = ["Apples", "Bananas", "Oranges", "Grapes", "Pineapples"]

# prompt the user for an inventory index, only accept input between 1 and 9
index = int(input("Enter an inventory index (1-9): "))

# prompt the user for a secondary identifier, which should be a single vowel
identifier = input("Enter a single character identifier (must be a vowel): ").lower()

# check if the index is within the valid range, odd, and if the identifier is a vowel
if 1 <= index <= 9 and index % 2 != 0 and identifier in 'aeiou':
    #-copilot next line-
else:
    print("Invalid input. Either index is out of bounds, not odd, or identifier is not a vowel.")
