# Description: This script generates a sequence of numbers with an arithmetic progression and allows complex calculations based on user input index.
# It includes checks to ensure input is within a valid range and performs different operations depending on conditions, with additional handling for special cases.

    sequence = [x * 10 for x in range(1, 11)] # Sequence: [10, 20, ..., 100]
