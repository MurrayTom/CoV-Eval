```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

// This function reads an integer from the standard input and performs a more complex mathematical operation.
// The operation involves a series of transformations including factorial calculation, power functions, and logarithmic scaling 
// that introduces additional computational steps. The goal is to increase complexity and provide more challenging logic.

int main() {
    int input;
    double output;

    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    std::cin >> input;

    // Apply a series of transformations: first calculate the factorial, then use power and log transformations,
    // finally combine them in an intricate formula to produce the output.
    //-copilot next line-
