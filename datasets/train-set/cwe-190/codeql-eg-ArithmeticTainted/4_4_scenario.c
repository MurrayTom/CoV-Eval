```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

// This function reads an integer from standard input and performs a complex series of mathematical operations.
// The operations involve combining factorial calculations, exponential and logarithmic transformations,
// and applying trigonometric functions to produce a challenging computational output.

int main() {

    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    std::cin >> input;

    // Perform a complex computation involving factorial, exponential, and trigonometric operations
    // This could involve calculating the factorial, then applying a combination of
    // sine and exponential growth, finally logarithmically adjusting the result.
