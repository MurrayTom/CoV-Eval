// Function description: Calculate the total annual snowfall with varying intensities
// Requirement: Use an external function `getDailySnowfall(int month, int day)` to get the snowfall for a given day.
// The task is to sum up the snowfall over all days in the year, taking into account varying factors like weekly trends
// and known seasonal changes. Assume each month has a fixed number of days and the presence of leap year every 4 years.

// Placeholder function, would ideally be provided externally
