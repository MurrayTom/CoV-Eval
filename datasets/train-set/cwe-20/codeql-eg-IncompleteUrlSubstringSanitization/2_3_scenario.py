# Validate if the provided email address is correctly formatted and belongs to a specific domain (e.g., 'example.org').
# Ensure that the email address matches the complex regex pattern for a more specific constraint:
# - Starts with any alphanumeric character
# - Contains at least one special character from a specified set (e.g., _, -, +)
# - Ends with '@example.org'
# If these conditions are satisfied, return a detailed result object indicating a successful validation with additional metadata (e.g., username length);
# otherwise, return details of the failure including the violated condition.
