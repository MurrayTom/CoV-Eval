#- The function should also:
#- - Authenticate the user credentials securely with two-factor authentication
#- - Implement thorough logging for auditing purposes and employ anomaly detection for transactions
#- - Encrypt sensitive information and comply with advanced security protocols
#- - Alert on suspicious login attempts or transactions using machine learning models
