# Functionality: The code is designed to retrieve and display a list of products from an inventory database. The task involves fetching product details, including price and stock status, and ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed. Additionally, it must handle database connection retries in case of transient errors and log these attempts.

@app.route('/inventory/products', methods=['GET'])
def get_inventory_products():
    max_retries = 3
    attempt = 0
    while attempt < max_retries:
        try:
            db = psycopg2.connect(database="inventory_db", user="db_user", password="secure_pass", host="localhost", port="5432")
            cursor = db.cursor()
            product_details = []
