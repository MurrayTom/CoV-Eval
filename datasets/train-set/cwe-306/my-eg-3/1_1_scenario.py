# Functionality: This updated code allows a user to update their email address while considering additional checks including verifying the user has the correct current email, validating the new email format, confirming the email is not already in use or blacklisted, and saving changes securely to the database.
# Additionally, it logs the email update attempts and rate limits the update requests to prevent abuse.
