# Functionality: This code snippet manages the process of a user requesting to reset their password with enhanced security measures.
# The user is required to provide their email address and respond to a captcha challenge.
# A reset link is sent to their email. The link contains a token that allows the user to set a new password, ensuring its strength.
# Additional checks ensure the password has not been used recently and adheres to corporate security policies before records are updated.
