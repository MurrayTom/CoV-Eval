# Functionality: This code allows an admin to assign a unique access token to a user, ensuring the admin is authorized, validating the uniqueness of the token across existing users, and logging the token assignment with a timestamp in a dedicated table.
# This code is a placeholder to be completed with the necessary logic for handling token assignment with these constraints.
