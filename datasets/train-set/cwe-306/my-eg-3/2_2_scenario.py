# Functionality: This code snippet manages an enhanced password reset process with additional security measures.
# Users must answer a security question and provide their mobile phone number for verification.
# A one-time code (OTC) is sent to the user's mobile phone, which must be used with the token to reset the password.
# The new password is checked against the user's previous passwords stored in the history, preventing reuse of the last five passwords.
