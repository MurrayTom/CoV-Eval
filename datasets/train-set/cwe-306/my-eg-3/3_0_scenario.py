# Functionality: The code retrieves, processes, and displays a list of products along with their pricing details and stock availability from a database. The task involves fetching product details, calculating any applicable discounts based on predefined criteria, and returning them in a structured JSON format with error handling for database connectivity and data processing anomalies.
# This code will serve as a context for the development of the complete logic.
