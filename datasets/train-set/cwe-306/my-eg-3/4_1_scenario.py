# Functionality: This function updates the user's password with the following checks: 
# - Verifies the user is logged in.
# - Validates the strength of the new password.
# - Confirms the new password does not match any previous passwords stored in the database for enhanced security.
# This code is a placeholder to be completed with the necessary logic for handling the password update under these constraints.
