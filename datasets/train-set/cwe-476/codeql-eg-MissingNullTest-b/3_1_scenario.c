// Function: Calculate average number of pages of an array of books within a certain year range.
// Requirements: Extend the functionality to handle an array of books, calculate the average number of pages for books published within a specified year range, and sort the books based on their publication year before calculation. Manage dynamic memory allocation and deallocation for both books array and individual book instances. Add error checking for each operation and enhance the complexity of sorting and averaging steps.

void process_books(book *books, int n, int startYear, int endYear) {
    // Dynamic memory allocation for books
    books = (book *)malloc(n * sizeof(book));
    if (books == NULL) {
        // Handle memory allocation failure
        perror("Failed to allocate memory for books array");

    // Initialize books with some data and additional complex sorting and calculation
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

        // Sort the books based on the publication year using a more complex algorithm, e.g., merge sort
        
        // Calculate average number of pages for books within [startYear, endYear]
