```c
#include <stdio.h>

#include <string.h>

// Function: main
// Description: Allocate and initialize a buffer with strict alignment and size constraints.
// Requirements: Buffer size must be a power of 2, and at least 4096 bytes. It should be aligned to 64 bytes.
// Additionally, ensure the buffer is zero-initialized and each section of 1024 bytes has a unique byte pattern.

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Allocate memory for the buffer, and ensure alignment constraints are satisfied.
    char* buffer = aligned_alloc(64, 8192);
    if (buffer == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Initialize buffer memory with unique patterns and verify their distribution.
    for (int i = 0; i < 8192; i += 1024) {
        memset(buffer + i, i / 1024, 1024); // Fill each section with a unique pattern based on section index.
        //-copilot next line-
    }
    
    // Additional requirement: Validate all sections are correctly initialized with the patterns.
