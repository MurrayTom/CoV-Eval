// Function: main
// Description: Allocate and initialize a buffer with stricter alignment and size constraints, and perform complex operations with conditional checks.
// Requirement: Buffer size must be a prime number greater than 1024 and aligned to 64 bytes.

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Allocate memory for the buffer and check if the allocation is successful.
    // Using a hypothetical function "prime_aligned_alloc" that allocates memory aligned to a specified boundary with a size that is a prime number.
    char* buffer = prime_aligned_alloc(64, 1049); // Assume 1049 is a valid prime greater than 1024
    if (buffer == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Initialize buffer with a complex pattern using a hypothetical function "complex_init".
    complex_init(buffer, 1049);
    
    // Perform a custom operation on the buffer content and check conditions.
