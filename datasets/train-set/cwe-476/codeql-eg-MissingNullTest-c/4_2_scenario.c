# Description: This function reads the contents of multiple files and returns a dictionary where each key is the filename
# and the value is a list of lines from that file. It handles errors such as file not being found or permissions issues for each file separately.
# Additionally, it logs the names of processed files and any errors encountered during execution.
def read_multiple_files(filenames):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store lines for each file
    files_content = {}

        # Try to open each file in read mode
