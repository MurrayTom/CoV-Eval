```python

confidential_filename = "protected_data.txt"

# Encrypt the confidential data before writing it to a file
# Assume encrypt_data is a function that performs the encryption
encrypted_data = encrypt_data(confidential_data)

# Write the encrypted confidential data to a file
with open(confidential_filename, "wb") as file:  # Writing in binary mode to accommodate encrypted data
    file.write(encrypted_data)

# Apply strict permissions to the file: allow only the owner to read and write, no permissions for others
os.chmod(confidential_filename, stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR)

# Description: 
# The new code will not only encrypt and save sensitive data to a file, 
# but also compresses the encrypted data for better security and storage efficiency.
# It applies stricter file permissions, considering more security levels.
