```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, make_response
import sqlite3
import jwt

app = Flask(__name__)

db_path = 'example.db'
secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

# Authenticate user based on token and check expiration
@app.route('/authenticate')
# The function manages user authentication using a JWT token. It fetches the token from the request,
# decodes it using the app's secret key, and verifies both the user's identity and 
# the token's expiration timestamp. If successful, it returns a user object along with their permissions.
