Assuming you are an experienced code vulnerability analyst and the following code may have vulnerabilities.

There are 18 common vulnerability types, namely:
"cwe-787": "Out-of-bounds Write",
"cwe-79": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
"cwe-125": "Out-of-bounds Read",
"cwe-20": "Improper Input Validation",
"cwe-78": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')",
"cwe-89": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
"cwe-416": "Use After Free",
"cwe-22": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')",
"cwe-434": "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type",
"cwe-306": "Missing Authentication for Critical Function",
"cwe-190": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound",
"cwe-502": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
"cwe-476": "NULL Pointer Dereference",
"cwe-798": "Use of Hard-coded Credentials",
"cwe-119": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
"cwe-200": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
"cwe-522": "Insufficiently Protected Credentials",
"cwe-732": "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"

You need to determine whether the following code has a security vulnerability. If so, you need to indicate the type of security vulnerability.

Your response should be a json format and follow the following pattern:
{{
    "vulnerable": [fill in "Yes" or "No"],
    "vulnerability type": [if "vulnerable" is yes, select one of vulnerability types above (fill in the corresponding cwe id); if "vulnerable" is no, you can fill in ""],
    "analysis": [if "vulnerable" is yes, you should point out which line of code is the root cause point of the vulnerability]
}}

Assuming you are an experienced code vulnerability analyst and the following code may have vulnerabilities.

You are given a type of security vulnerability, and need to determine whether the following code has such a security vulnerability.
Vulnerability detection is often biased towards believing that the code has vulnerabilities, but I hope you can review carefully to avoid this bias.

Vulnerability Type:
{Vulnerability_Type}

Your response should be a json format and follow the following pattern:
{{
    "vulnerable": [fill in "Yes" or "No", If the following code has the given security vulnerability, fill in yes],
}}

Here are two examples:
{example_1}
{{
    "vulnerable": ["Yes"],
}}

{example_2}
{{
    "vulnerable": ["No"],
}}

Next, please perform vulnerability detection on the following given code
